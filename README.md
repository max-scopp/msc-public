# msc-public

This is a collection of personal components which may, or may not be used in real-world products.

If you want, you can try it. There is no official support, this is just a public version of it.

It's tailored to my use-cases and is NOT generalized, like bootstrap. It's purpesfully flexible, hencewhy there are some quirks to make it play well (pretty much) everywhere.
